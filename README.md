Implementation of a character-level language model using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with the PyTorch library. The code trains the RNN on a dataset of names to generate new sequences of characters that resemble names.

1. Loads a dataset of names from a file named 'names.txt' and processes the data.
2. Creates a character-level RNN model using PyTorch.
3. Defines functions for training the model, generating new sequences of characters, and sampling from the model.
4. Trains the RNN model on the dataset of names.
5. Generates new sequences of characters (names) using the trained model.
